JWT Authentication
This project demonstrates the implementation of JWT (JSON Web Token) authentication in a secure and scalable way. It serves as a guide for developers to protect their APIs using token-based authentication instead of traditional session-based methods.

Features
Token-Based Authentication: Securely authenticate users with JWT tokens.
User Login and Token Generation: Issue a signed JWT upon successful login.
Middleware Integration: Protect REST API endpoints with JWT middleware.
Role-Based Access Control (RBAC): Restrict access to specific endpoints based on user roles.
Token Validation: Verify tokens on each request to ensure authenticity and prevent unauthorized access.
Token Expiry and Refresh: Implement token expiration and refresh mechanisms for enhanced security.
Scalability: Stateless authentication enables horizontal scaling without managing sessions.


Technologies Used
Java / Spring Boot: Backend development.
JWT (JSON Web Token): Token generation and validation.
Spring Security: Secure the API endpoints.
Maven/Gradle: Dependency management.
Postman: API testing.
